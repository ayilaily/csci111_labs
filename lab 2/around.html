<h2> <ol> Sibin Lakes </ol> </h2>
<h3> <ol> The Sibin Lakes offer breathtaking views and a variety of water-based activities. </ol> </h3>
<p> The Sibin Lakes are a group of five lakes (Sadyrkol, Tortkara, Shalkar, Korjinkol, and Karakol) located in East Kazakhstan Province. Their total area is 32 square kilometers (20 sq. mi), while their depth varies from 2.5 to 38 meters (6.5-125 ft). Framed by granite mountain peaks, the lakes are a popular destination among beach-goers and hikers.

People come here to admire panoramic views from the rocky peaks of the Baiga, Medvedka, and Koktau Mountains, marvel at ancient rock paintings, and try their luck at finding rare minerals such as almandine and black tourmaline. Near the lakes, you can find the ruins of a Buddhist monastery, something you don’t expect to see in Kazakhstan. According to some legends, a golden statue of Buddha is submerged at the bottom of one of the lakes. This legend attracts divers who dream of discovering it.

The lakes also draw fishermen from all over the region, allured by the chance to catch pike, carp, and roach. In winter the lakes become a nice spot for ice fishing.

All along the lake shores are recreation areas offering an extreme park, a climbing wall, a bungee jumping spot, and grounds for volleyball, tennis, and soccer. </p>

<h2> <ol> Kiin-Kirish Valley </ol> </h2>

<h2> <ol> Zaysan Lake </ol> </h2>
<p> Lake Zaysan is undoubtedly one of the oldest bodies of water on the planet. Its exact age is so difficult to determine. According to some indirect signs, scientists suggest that the reservoir was formed at the end of the Cretaceous period, more than 65 million years ago, and therefore dinosaurs graced its waters. If this hypothesis is correct, then the Zaysan may be even older than Lake Baikal, whose age, according to the common opinion, is about 25 million years. </p>
